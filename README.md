# Estate-Predictor

## Overview
This project focuses on forecasting housing prices in Boston using data analysis, data engineering, data cleaning, and machine learning techniques. The information is based on authentic Boston-based data sourced from the UCI dataset.

## Project Description
The primary goal of this project is to predict housing prices in Boston by analyzing key property features. We have used a combination of data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning to achieve this goal. Our approach includes:

- **Data Collection**: We sourced authentic data from the UCI dataset, which serves as the foundation for our analysis.

- **Data Cleaning**: We performed data cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data quality.

- **Data Engineering**: Feature engineering was carried out to extract meaningful insights from the dataset.

- **Data Visualization**: We used Python and Excel for data visualization to gain a better understanding of the data and identify patterns.

- **Machine Learning**: We employed the Scikit-learn library and built a machine learning model using a Random Forest algorithm to predict housing prices.
